Add reflections of lesson 1

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It made it easier to compare what was changed from before, so boom. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
It lets you learn from your past code. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
That sometimes your judgement may be flawed, and you commit too much or too little. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Use it to check all the changes that have been done to one document (log) or to see the differences between two commits (diff)
